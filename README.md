## Neuromorphic-Compute-Framework

Welcome to Qubit! Qubit is the first neuromorphic compute framework on Solana, designed to revolutionize the ai agent landscape. Qubit combines the efficiency of neuromorphic compute with LLM's to create the fastest agents available. For more information, visit our whitepaper and twitter below:

## How it works 

Our whitepapers explains **why** traditional agents are considered slow when compared to neuromorphic compute. Neuromorphic compute is the hardware setup that lies behind the agents and directly contributes to their ability to process information, respond to changes, recognize patterns, and more. 

This Github details how we have our agents setup and how we incorporate it with neuromorphic compute. We want to mention that if you do not have neuromorphic hardware available and setup to handle the agents, they function as any other agent would. Our code is open-sourced and can be implemented by anyone, but it is the hardware that truly makes the agents as effective as ours. This is what we bring to the table that is unlike any other products.
